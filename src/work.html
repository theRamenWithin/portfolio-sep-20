            Toy mouse squeak roll over weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed adventure always cat fur is the new black yet cats are the world or my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too for cough hairball on conveniently placed pants. Lounge in doorway meow wake up human for food at 4am lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep or leave fur on owners clothes try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. I rule on my back you rub my tummy i bite you hard. I shall purr myself to sleep. Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. Lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody leave dead animals as gifts find something else more interesting.
